        <p>and the chase of productivity in a computer.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>unsure how it began but probably trying to achive a way of minimizing effort on
clean and working desktop. It isn't effortless but primarly using the keyboard
for interacting with the desktop enables a quick acess to useful
resources/programs/projects.</p>
<p>It isn't for everyone, I think but at least for me, the hability to have quick
acess to desktops with the methods of working/research tidy, enables the quick
acess to documentation, code, notes and references, maximizing the ?workflow?.</p>

<li>´dwm´ <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm.suckless.org</a>
Looking back, I quite enjoyed ´dwm´, even if it was a thought nut to crack and
harmed the academic progress I might have achived otherwise sticking to what
everyone else was using. being needlessly hard is a trait me (on myself) and
´dwm´ share so after learning and some changes it was good enought for the
workflow i did, mainly checking documentaion and notes on the projects i was
doing to coding in emacs (or atom when coolaboratively), terminals for testing
along with extra desktops for communication (emails and discord) and non work
related.</li>
</ol>
<p>this window manager fulfilled the minimal and customizable, using a toolbox (C)
I was familiar with, others might have been better starter options but it ended
up performing quite well. ´dmenu´, ´st´ and various status bar implementations
were used and after some patches like ´scratchpad´, and configuring media keys i
didn't bother too much with it and just used it. <em>no rice, it looked default</em></p>

<li>´leftwm´ <a href="https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm">github/leftwm</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Right now this what i'm using, it's great but i'm still learning and sometimes
miss some things that I was used to. It's not as minimal or as costumizable as
other options, but it has matched my expectations and don't expect to switch
soon (and <em>hopefully</em> contribute in it's development).</p>
<p>I still don't know how some things can be made better. knowing the keybinds and
layouts might help but the simplest use I make is enough.</p>
<p>Right now i'm procastinating on: configuring scratchpads; knowing more about the
default layouts. <strong>TODO</strong></p>
<p>setting up polybar was great, and right now it looks good, with some faults
related to the maximum size of the names of windows. additional information on
the current layout might also be useful but not until I learn the keybinds.</p>
