is that first edited post. somethings are missing. add a reference to digital gardens.\n\nwhile all this could have been done earlier (in life), only here and now i'll try to experiment/learn/make a personal website. some things i'll think are not good enough to put here, but others such as references to works made by others that i wish to register in a more permanent (and accessible) way than trying to recall or finding the note i wrote, i'll make an effort to publish them here. and later hopefully appreciate.\nusing freecodecamp, i should know some css and html to format this page, but at the time of writing this i'll just hope it's good enough for now. the idea is to use this page as a playground, and test some ways of making enotes available alongside any material/resource/reference/insight/finding.\nsome limitations i would like to overcome, mostly my own. i'll try to search for the most modular solution available, and improve it in anyway i can. simplicity should be considered but not for it's own sake.\nP.S: i like org-mode files but also just simple text files, but also irrationally not like markdown files as much. Check later wiki type notes/formatting and maybe some other, and try to implement/find a possible modular solution.

I am currently 19, and writing my thesis in the area of mathematical\nphysics. At risk of tooting my own horn, my advisor has been saying that the\nthesis is progressing quite fast, and if I keep the work up, it could be\npublished in a journal.\nIt has been my dream to start a career in academia, and I feel like this is the\nfirst step towards that. The thing is, I have been quite discouraged by the many\nvoices online talking about how difficult getting positions is, about how tenure\nis a pipe dream, and so on.\nSo, in short, I was wondering if I am on a good track if I start publishing\nearly, and finish my masters and phd at a young age. Does age play an important\nrole for academic careers?\nI also wanted to ask what I can do to maximize the chances of finding good\npositions later on. I am starting to have more contact with actual researchers\nnow that I am working on my thesis, how can I make a good impression and make\ncontacts for the future? Is there anything that I can do to improve my odds of a\nsuccessful career?\nu/NMJD\nGetting on the academic track early and being young when you graduate is not in\nand of itself an advantage on the job market, it depends on what you've done\nwith your time.\nI've known students who were really bright and had lots of early opportunities\nthat helped them progress quickly through school. I've known students who were\nvery bright but got their undergraduate degree and then worked in industry for a\nfew years before returning to school for their PhD. I've known students who were\nvery bright but contributed to their home families in ways that delayed them\nstarting school for a few years. The age played honestly less of a factor than\nthe question of: \"do you have the skills to manage your life and spend a long\ntime on something even after it becomes uninteresting?\" -- because this kicks in\nin graduate school in a way that's not as represented in undergrad.\nFor some students they are much better at that after they have had a\nnon-academic job, other students can do it even without that.\nRegarding if the academic job market is worth it: that isn't actually a decision\nyou have to make right now. Your career plans can change while you're getting\nyour masters and PhD.\nI'd say, if you're interested in the work and want to continue doing it, go get\nyour masters and PhD. If it's possible to work your undergrad thesis up into a\npublication, definitely do that. Then while you're in school, be sure to focus\non your research (get your work published, go to conferences, etc) but also be\nsure to watch and ask questions of people in jobs you're interested in. How\nhappy do profs look? Why did they become professors? What surprised them about\nbeing a professor? What do they spend most of their time on?\nThe academic job market in the US is tough, that's all I can speak to. I have\nfamily in Germany so I know about academic differences there, but am not sure\nabout the job market. For me, based on what I like doing, the academic job\nmarket was still worth it. If it is or isn't worth it to you will likely be a\nlittle more clear during and after grad school. If, during grad school, you\ndecide you don't want to stay in academia, there are many other things you can\ndo with a physics PhD.\nu/neazwaflcasd\nOne step at a time. I mentored many undergraduate and graduate students as a\npostdoc. They all thought of academia as some sort of Shangri-La. Only ~10% of\nthem went on to academic careers. All others found positions they were happier\nwith in industry, got burned out by the grind of grad school, or completely\nchanged course for a variety of reasons (family, children, etc.). In fact, one\nof them has a story that is nearly identical to yours (not sure if yours will\nend the same way, but here's an example). She told me \"she was destined to\nbecome a professor\" as an undergrad in an honors program. I recommend she slow\ndown and wait to see what the future holds. After 1 year of her doctoral program\nshe dropped out, got married, became a high school teacher, and started a family\n(3 kids now). She's happy, that's all that matters. Again, take it one step at a\ntime. You never know where life will take you!

There was a sketch, i wrote on a brief note that went over some factors\nthat hinder the doing and pushing into a later day where the grass is greener.\nThose factors were:\n\nthe lack of opportunities: where one thinks, in his current enviroment any\nplans he does on getting it done only results on him disapointing himself;\neffort: the will to do it is weaker than the effort he presumes it will take,\nand as a result he proclaims, to himself at least,it is too much work for him;\nresources: one can only use what his within his reach and his arms are to\nshort for such a task, he must ask for help, but his short arms will be unable\nto grasp anyone that might pull him up, and the anxiety of pulling someone\nelse with him in his desperate will to get up again from the depths he's in is\ntoo much too bear;\ncomplexity: it is beyond his grasp and he can't ask for help for fear of\nacknolegment of him being out of one's depth. He's alone and narcissistic on\nthinking it can't be done by anyone else but him, like it his task, his will,\nhis path.\n\nI'm unsure this is what I meant when writing these factors/notions, but it was\nreasoned trought tought that it felt like it. The first notion that ended up\nbeing crossed out after it encompassing to many factors was can. Being sure\nwe can do things is impossible if we can't preserve the current condition we are\nin until the task is done. We take into account many possible changes but an\nunreasonable amount of them might take the can into a can't and it all goes\ndown, into the depths, after that.\nWhile in the depths one will reason with it and get a grasp on many ways of\npulling it back together, but he must understand if he should rest and where to\nplace his trust, in himself or others that might help him. If he can do it\nalone, only he knows but until he can fully recover he is tired.\nThis last phrase doesn't make any sense beyond extending the felling that he is\nindeed tired.\n\n(update: 2023-02-09) I tried doing what i couldn't do earlier after a long\nbreak. It didn't get any easier, nor am i more motivated to do it. I shall do it\nhopefully soon, but the complexety and effort requirements seem imense.
