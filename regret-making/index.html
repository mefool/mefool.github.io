        <p>trying would make more or less regrets. or the same since the since only doing
would end this.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>just wish hindsight could be premeditated, trough meditation, thinking or taking
a break. but it often harder since most feedback is given at the end, and not
during difficulties that appear along the way. mountaineering is done with ropes
and endurance is a trait one must have to rise to the top, but trough perserance
and endurance only, climbing to the top would be dumb and a trap.</p>
<p>the wisdom to have a break or return home, only on the worst case can be enjoyed
and when regrets begin to bother us, forgetting how low we were, when that close
to the top, wishing we had just summited is normal.</p>
<p>if trying is related to endurance, then it might be because training is most
often done in comfort zones. endurance when we are low is harder, we face more
resistance, hardships and less opportunities (maybe). rising to the top involves
having the opportunity to come up, often with others, who thought we should be
good enought for the task at hand, and if helped would latter help back, as they
get better, and look expectantly for all to keep trying.</p>
<p>jimble jambo, just do the things, if you have time, and if not, make some
time. change the route back home and find a high place along the way, or avoid
low points. keep trying since summiting is easier when the conditions and
conditioning are good.</p>
