I'm okay, nothing's special is going on. I'm good.

*some of this post has been drafted before under the title: "wasting your
life/money/time", where i picked some of the well-written lines.*

all psyche is beyond comprehension and open for misunderstanding. feeling and
being are separate, but related directly and indirectly. mostly directly or is
it?

```
feeling/being | good | bad | (x,y,z,w)
         good |  78  |  10 | (x = 40, y = 10)
          bad |  10  |   2 | (z = 10, w = 40)
```

this verbatim table tries to provide an example of percentage estimates on the
time spent *feeling* good or bad while *being* good or bad. a graph on the
transitions between these states might also be insightful.

*estimates are hard.* `y` and `z` might represent hardships where we have no
control over and just allow things to go along. `w` the lowest of lows and `x`
the control and goal achivement we all desire, or the feeling we are doing what
we can and see the results.

another helpful concept might be *appear* where someone close or not as close
might be insightful, but it goes beyond the scope of this draft.

being/feeling well should to come from the fulfilment one is able to achieve,
and value brought from this activity. the appearing well should be only cosmetic
and beyond the reach of self, dependent on others well-being.
