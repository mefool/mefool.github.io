a few things changed, and a break on taking breaks, working for now, as I hope to get things in order

<!-- more -->

While I've not publically written some views or opinions, I've kept reaching for
goals that seem far. Sharing stuff is hard, you have to endure critisim, fair
and unfair, and embrace the wait until your efforts are valued, if ever.

On reaching for goals related to academics, I've relaized I wasn't moving
forward at the pace or effort required to accomplish them. Related to work, i
was playing around with long waits and low chances. And what might be considered
as a break as I searched for studies and work, ended up being a slight ego drain
as I precived the wrong feedback, from messages, mettings and calls.

Time to read has been great, but working has occupied more and more of the
presence, but it has been better. The academic path seems far, and opportunities
where it might be better aligned with it have gone by. On efforts best placed,
one should give himself to it and hope it pays off. While harsh on getting it
done and open to perfecionism, one needs to realize he is done.

i'm quite tired, soo far work has been grea and only partly the reason for not
writting here- but having written this, it is not wholly lost.
