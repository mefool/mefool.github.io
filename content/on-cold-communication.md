not bothering with introductions, or replies/answers just hoping it is seen/hear by someone.

Ignoring comprehension in conversation is dumb. Making the context known,
recognising possible and real misunderstandings, making the message clear and
concise, while matching both parties expectations of a great reply, is also
dumb.

The first dumb tries to express how not caring about the message, and how it is
understood shouldn’t get you very far, but sometimes it does, by luck and
chance.  Chance someone understood, and felt it deserved a reply. On the second
dumb, one feels like he should explain, increasing the chances but not the luck,
since about others’ minds and how they might understand it, one knows a bit less
than his own.

On doing just enough, there is this pleasure of finishing and knowing the shot
is shot, and it’s no longer on our hands. Might have done better tos, are beyond
the limits set when it was written and sent, being it time and the receivers
best attention period.

I no longer know where I’m going with this, head hurts and this time would have
been better spent reading. But let it be known the goal of this rant:

One should get a content minimum ready soon, and be ready to send it.  With this
minimum, you compare your updated message, and only make the message more
clear. Add annexes or sources, with the why it was added, making the
message more concise not less.
