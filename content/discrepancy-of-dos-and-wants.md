a review on factors and notions related to the dos and done
<!-- more -->

For the last few days there was a lack of motivations to keep at it, to getting
it done. There was a sketch, i wrote on a brief note that went over some factors
that hinder the doing and pushing into a later day where the grass is greener.
Those factors were:
+ the lack of opportunities: where one thinks, in his current enviroment any
  plans he does on getting it done only results on him disapointing himself;
+ effort: the will to do it is weaker than the effort he presumes it will take,
  and as a result he proclaims, to himself at least,it is too much work for him;
+ resources: one can only use what his within his reach and his arms are to
  short for such a task, he must ask for help, but his short arms will be unable
  to grasp anyone that might pull him up, and the anxiety of pulling someone
  else with him in his desperate will to get up again from the depths he's in is
  too much too bear;
+ complexity: it is beyond his grasp and he can't ask for help for fear of
  acknolegment of him being out of one's depth. He's alone and narcissistic on
  thinking it can't be done by anyone else but him, like it his task, his will,
  his path.

I'm unsure this is what I meant when writing these factors/notions, but it was
reasoned trought tought that it felt like it. The first notion that ended up
being crossed out after it encompassing to many factors was **can**. Being sure
we can do things is impossible if we can't preserve the current condition we are
in until the task is done. We take into account many possible changes but an
unreasonable amount of them might take the *can* into a *can't* and it all goes
down, into the depths, after that.  
While in the depths one will reason with it and get a grasp on many ways of
pulling it back together, but he must understand if he should rest and where to
place his trust, in himself or others that might help him. If he can do it
alone, only he knows but until he can fully recover he is tired.  
*This last phrase doesn't make any sense beyond extending the felling that he is
indeed tired.*

*(update: 2023-02-09)* I tried doing what i couldn't do earlier after a long
break. It didn't get any easier, nor am i more motivated to do it. I shall do it
hopefully soon, but the complexety and effort requirements seem imense.  Others
have completed similar tasks so I must also do them to match the expectections
of following a trodden path.

*note:* I don't talk like i've written this. I've read things than are much
better than i'm able to write and some can be considered similar. I'm unsure if
writing is done similar to how you think and you learn to think similar to how
you gain knowledge, and in that non-sensisible way turn thoughts into writing.
