and overcoming barriers of entry, fears of failure and imposter reckoning.

Redtaping yourself, due to anxiety or just being pessimistic about it (anything)
can be the main problem between fulfilment and melancholy.

It's always hard to recover from the optimistic outlooks on the future that
didn't come to pass, but the problem was the execution and not the goal setting,
even if it was too optimistic. Planning should be hard, and executing if not
harder must be softer, covering sharp corners, looking for ways of preventing
any fall. Fires always break at the worst times, and if anything can go wrong it
will, sooner or later.

However valuing whims, ideas, desires and urges, like a bunch of kids that are
just curious about how things/people/animals work, came to be, are used, can
improve/help or be helped. Some might see the value in learning and the intrict
desire to do something, if only they found and were able to learn and later
learn by doing the thing they wanted.

Maybe the enviroments don't provide those opportunities and as such getting the
idea of enabling learning/practice based on whims is just a small utopia,
***butt*** *wouldn't the world be bigger if we were all just a bunch of kids*.

Of course, we can't just strike the supports of society, but crushing some
peoples dreams to asure the continuing inequality of those with the resources to
pursue them until the fruit ripened and were able to return their investments.

Or maybe we could, by looking in a comunity level, continuing work on making
tasks more fulfilling and easier on mind, body and R&B/soul. The fruits of
labor/practice/reseach will generate a return, in hopes of the value being
generated being more for its own sake, looking for improvements, students and
teachers.

Since the academic redtape part was mostly ignored, it just gets boring fast due
any practice round while not mattering in any grand sense need to be graded,
presented, reported and formally presented, the wear and sometimes tear can be
overwhelming. The teacher-student relationship can be more communicative but
there is simply not time, and the student shouldn't expect there to be.

**TODO-unrelated:** just a small post on graph theory and some {AI; Machine
Learning; Neurscience} research on it; maybe also one on psychology and
philosophy; review that letter and make a note on it maybe.
