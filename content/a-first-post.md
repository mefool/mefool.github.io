here is that first edited post. somethings are missing. add a reference to digital gardens.

<!-- more -->

while all this could have been done earlier (in life), only here and now i'll try to experiment/learn/make a personal website. some things i'll think are not good enough to put here, but others such as references to works made by others that i wish to register in a more permanent (and accessible) way than trying to recall or finding the note i wrote, i'll make an effort to publish them here. and later hopefully appreciate.
using freecodecamp, i should know some css and html to format this page, but at the time of writing this i'll just hope it's good enough for now. the idea is to use this page as a playground, and test some ways of making enotes available alongside any material/resource/reference/insight/finding.

some limitations i would like to overcome, mostly my own. i'll try to search for the most modular solution available, and improve it in anyway i can. simplicity should be considered but not for it's own sake.



**P.S:** i like org-mode files but also just simple text files, but also *irrationally* not like markdown files as much. Check later wiki type notes/formatting and maybe some other, and try to implement/find a possible modular solution. Will try to keep using Emacs.

**PP.S:** this was a bit tedious to write, later experiment with org-export maybe
