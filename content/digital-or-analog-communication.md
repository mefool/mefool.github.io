why it's weird to talk to no-one in particular, keeping things/ideas to ourselves.

<!-- more -->

With digital i mean this, writing, converting a stream of thoughts into digital
means, and sometimes making it's reach much *wider* due to the reduced resources
to spread these hopefully new ideas. And with classic I mean the way it's
avoiding the use of an encapsulating format that prevents the complete
dimensions of voices, words, gestures of being observed, received or just
expericenced.

This was not a very subjective way of putting it, but the main idea it's that
each option has it's own set of advantages and disavantages. Some limitations
bring creativity into the mainframe of what we do, while others prevent us from
ever fully expressing what we want to do.

Human Resources people will without a doubt know more about this, but emails are
just some kind of letters that we reduced the dimensions of expression into a
bunch of characters, and hope that by the speed of light will be answered as
soon as the machines grant. The fact that the error-prone humans enter into any
machine that transmit messages into each other only make delays, mistakes,
regrets and happenstance to spread, as it does by any classic means, but the
machines would function better if this didn't happen.

There's no hope of a communication method being error-prof, or maybe I don't
know much about communication and quantum-entanglement.

*I just wish I was better at communication and decision making, and knowing how
to accomplish those long term goals, that seem so far away.* It goes beyong the
digital but sometimes decisions seem to be binary. While on the present they
might be, just hope the future implements some new ideas.

**TODO1:** just make that billards game in rust with prime numbers or color colisions.
**TODO2:** and do research graph theory and implement some new ideas.
**TODO3:** make things and learn while/by doing them hopefully.
