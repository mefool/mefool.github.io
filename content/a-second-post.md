The first post said something like **hi.**
Right now I'm just tired of wanting things to just work, to having an easier time on most challenges that come up.
It seems I must apply the [*principle of parsomony*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) and just make exceptions on things that the expected effort is/was much larger than effort that is being uphelp.

I wanted to use any file type as note/post and be able to generate a webpage from it, and use tags to keep things accessible. A trully modular solution seemed to make use [pandoc](pandoc), but better solutions might be elsewhere butI haven't found them yet. I want things to work, but the effort I place in this must be lower than any other goals that might fulfill other goals.

Right now, [*Ockham's razor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) tells me I should use `org` for drafts and `md` for posts, and it seems sensible enough.
